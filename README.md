# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection – Using CNN

> “There is no spoon… only tensors.”  
> — Morpheus (…probably 😎)

When medicine meets machine intelligence.  
This project builds a Deep Learning powered system that scans **brain MRI images** and predicts:

- Glioma  
- Meningioma  
- Pituitary Tumor  
- **No Tumor (Safe)**  

Built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and wrapped inside a **Django web application**, this system acts like a **Neural Oracle** that stares into MRI scans and whispers the truth.
